                                          slide 11 - desired features

    Features I would love to see...

-----------------------------------------

    - Tapping into UIAppearance
    - Some stylesheet packages (bootstrap for iOS)
    - Support multiple stylenames, or add styleclasses (composability)
    Or how about...
    - A development environment that provides
      debugging information, UI manipulation,
      and accessibility information.  Pluggable,
      too, so that it's easy to add per-app plugins
